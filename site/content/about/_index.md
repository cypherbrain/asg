Hi, I’m creating a **one-page adventure every Monday**. They're designed to work with Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, but *you can adapt them to your favorite system!*

Like what I'm creating? **Follow** me on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/arcticsquall)** and **[Instagram](https://instagram.com/arcticsquall)** to get updates when I post each adventure! I’m also very reachable on social media and I’d love to hear your thoughts.

I hope you enjoy my work. **Happy adventuring!**
